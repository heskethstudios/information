A few things, if I could kindly ask that you try and include as much information in a report as you can, I do appreciate that you can be sending one in the heat of battle though.

Can I also ask that if you are joining the beta testing that you familiarise your self with what has changed.

Thank you all for the bug reports and helping to improve the beta, at some point will have to decide when to release it to the main branch.

Cheers,
Rob
