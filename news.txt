Version 1.0.9.191 (12/11/25)
Tiny but important patch out today to fix the following:
* Fixed issue where FPS command mode gets stuck when exiting direct pilot mode of starship
* Fixed being able to personal drop pod into the enemy HQ
* Fixed bug where AI wasn't building outposts at the start.
* Fixed back button on options menu

Launch has gone super well and can see a lot of people are enjoying the game and giving some great feedback, if you are having fun please consider giving the game a little thumbs up on the Store page.

Cheers,
Rob
